"""The service: wrap a Generator and expose it over ZeroMQ.

One process owns the instrument (or the simulator) and the Generator. It runs
two extra threads, exactly like clMag's service:
  * publisher  -- owns the PUB socket; sends a status frame at `status_hz` and
                  forwards generator events as they happen (one socket, because a
                  ZeroMQ socket must be used from a single thread).
  * commander  -- owns the REP socket; receives a JSON command, dispatches it to
                  the generator, and replies.

Bind to tcp://0.0.0.0:<port> and the same code serves a client on localhost or
across the lab network -- only the address the client dials changes.
