"""The service: wrap a Chopper brain and expose it over ZeroMQ.

One process owns the controller (or the simulator) and the brain. It runs two
threads of its own (the brain runs a third, its poll thread):
  * publisher  -- owns the PUB socket; sends a status frame at `status_hz` and
                  forwards brain events as they happen (one socket, because a
                  ZeroMQ socket must be used from a single thread).
  * commander  -- owns the REP socket; receives a JSON command, dispatches it to
                  the brain, and replies. A reply means ACCEPTED: "the wheel is
                  at the new frequency" is `locked` in the status, later.

Bind to tcp://0.0.0.0:<port> and the same code serves a client on localhost or
across the lab network -- only the address the client dials changes.
